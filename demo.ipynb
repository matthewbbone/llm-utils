Key consequences are relativity of simultaneity, time dilation (Δt = γΔτ), length contraction (L = L0/γ), and the invariant spacetime interval s^2 = −c^2Δt^2 + Δx^2 + Δy^2 + Δz^2. Energy and momentum combine into a four-vector giving E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4; the famous rest-energy relation E = mc^2 is a special case. \\n\\nGR (1915) generalizes SR to include gravity by replacing the flat spacetime of SR with a curved spacetime whose geometry is determined by mass–energy. The equivalence principle (local indistinguishability of acceleration and gravity) motivates describing gravity as spacetime curvature. The dynamics are given by Einstein’s field equations: G_{μν} = (8πG/c^4) T_{μν}, where G_{μν} encodes curvature (from the metric g_{μν}) and T_{μν} is the stress–energy tensor. Free-falling objects follow geodesics (straightest possible paths) in curved spacetime; light follows null geodesics. Observable predictions include gravitational time dilation, light deflection by mass, perihelion precession of Mercury, black holes (strong-field solutions like Schwarzschild or Kerr), and gravitational waves.

It\\'s built upon two fundamental postulates:1.  The Principle of Relativity: The laws of physics are the same for all observers in any inertial (non-accelerating) frame of reference.2.  The Principle of the Speed of Light: The speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or the motion of the light source.These seemingly simple postulates lead to profound and counter-intuitive consequences:Spacetime: Special relativity showed that space and time are not separate entities but are interwoven into a single four-dimensional continuum called spacetime.Time Dilation: Time can slow down for an object that is moving relative to an observer. An observer watching a clock on a fast-moving object would see it ticking more slowly than their own clock.Length Contraction: The length of an object moving at very high speeds, as measured by a stationary observer, appears shorter in the direction of its motion.Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mc²): This famous equation demonstrates that mass and energy are interchangeable and are different forms of the same thing. A small amount of mass can be converted into a tremendous amount of energy, a principle that explains phenomena like how stars shine and nuclear reactions.General Relativity (1915): This theory extends special relativity by incorporating gravity. Einstein proposed that gravity isn\\'t a force in the traditional sense, but rather a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy.Imagine a heavy object, like a star, placed on a stretched rubber sheet (representing spacetime). The object creates a \"dent\" or curve in the sheet. Other objects moving nearby will follow these curves, giving the appearance of being \"pulled\" towards the heavy object. This \"bending\" of spacetime dictates how objects move, including planets orbiting stars and light bending around massive objects (gravitational lensing).General relativity explains large-scale physical phenomena such as the movement of planets, the formation of black holes, and the expansion of the universe. Its predictions have been confirmed by numerous observations, including the bending of starlight around the Sun during a solar eclipse and the existence of gravitational waves.'},\n",
