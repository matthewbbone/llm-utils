       "  'COLLEGE_STUDENT_EXPLANATION': 'Albert Einstein\\'s theory of relativity fundamentally reshaped our understanding of space, time, mass, and energy, comprising two interconnected theories: special relativity and general relativity. Special Theory of Relativity (1905): Special relativity deals with the relationship between space, time, mass, and energy for objects moving at constant velocities (inertial reference frames), excluding gravity. It is built upon two core postulates: 1. The Principle of Relativity: The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another. 2. The Constancy of the Speed of Light: The speed of light in a vacuum (c) is the same for all inertial observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or the observer. These postulates lead to several counter-intuitive but experimentally verified consequences: Time Dilation: Time passes more slowly for an object in motion relative to a stationary observer. For example, clocks on fast-moving spacecraft run slightly slower than those on Earth. Length Contraction: The length of an object appears to contract in the direction of its motion when observed from a different inertial frame. Relativity of Simultaneity: Events that appear simultaneous to one observer may not appear simultaneous to another observer in relative motion. Mass-Energy Equivalence: Expressed by the famous equation E=mc², this principle states that mass and energy are interchangeable and equivalent, with the speed of light squared acting as the conversion factor. This implies that even a small amount of mass can be converted into a tremendous amount of energy. It also means an object\\'s observed mass increases as it approaches the speed of light, making it impossible for any object with mass to reach \\'c\\'. General Theory of Relativity (1915): General relativity extends special relativity to include gravity and accelerating reference frames. It redefines gravity not as a force acting between masses, but as a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. Key concepts include: Spacetime Curvature: Massive objects, like planets and stars, warp the four-dimensional fabric of spacetime around them. This curvature dictates the paths that other objects (including light) will follow. Objects in freefall are simply following the \"straightest possible paths\" (geodesics) within this curved spacetime, rather than being pulled by a force. Einstein Field Equations: These complex mathematical equations describe the relationship between the geometry of spacetime (its curvature) and the distribution of energy, momentum, and stress within it. Gravitational Time Dilation: Time runs slower in stronger gravitational fields. This effect is crucial for the accuracy of GPS satellites, which must account for the slight difference in time experienced due to Earth\\'s gravity. Gravitational Lensing: The bending of light as it passes near massive objects, a phenomenon predicted by general relativity and observed during solar eclipses, where starlight was seen to bend around the Sun. Black Holes: General relativity predicts the existence of regions in spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. General relativity provides a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of spacetime, offering a more accurate understanding of large-scale cosmic phenomena than Newton\\'s law of universal gravitation.'},\n",
