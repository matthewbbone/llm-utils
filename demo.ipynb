       "  'COLLEGE_STUDENT_EXPLANATION': \"Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, proposed in 1905 and 1915, revolutionized modern physics by redefining space and time. It comprises two interconnected theories: special relativity and general relativity. Special Relativity (1905) addresses the relationship between space and time for objects in uniform motion (constant velocity). It is founded on two core postulates: 1. The Principle of Relativity: The laws of physics are consistent for all observers in uniform motion (inertial frames of reference). 2. The Principle of the Constancy of the Speed of Light: The speed of light in a vacuum ('c') is constant for all inertial observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or the observer. These postulates lead to several counter-intuitive yet experimentally verified consequences: Time Dilation: Time passes more slowly for an object in motion relative to a stationary observer. This means a clock moving at high speeds will tick slower than a stationary clock. Length Contraction: The length of an object moving at high speed, as measured by a stationary observer, appears shorter in the direction of its motion. Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mc²): Mass and energy are interchangeable. This famous equation shows that mass increases with velocity, and it implies that nothing with mass can travel faster than the speed of light. Relativity of Simultaneity: Events that are simultaneous for one observer may not be simultaneous for another observer in relative motion. General Relativity (1915) extends special relativity to incorporate gravity and accelerated frames of reference. It postulates that gravity is not a force, but rather a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. Key concepts of General Relativity include: Spacetime Curvature: Massive objects, such as planets and stars, warp the fabric of spacetime around them. Other objects, including light, follow these curves in spacetime, which we perceive as the effect of gravity. Equivalence Principle: The effects of gravity are locally indistinguishable from the effects of acceleration. Gravitational Time Dilation: Time passes more slowly in stronger gravitational fields. This means clocks run slower closer to massive objects. Light Deflection: Light rays bend in a gravitational field as they traverse curved spacetime. The theory of relativity has been extensively confirmed by experiments and observations, and it has essential practical applications, such as ensuring the accuracy of GPS systems by accounting for relativistic effects. It also forms the basis for understanding astronomical phenomena like black holes, gravitational waves, and the expansion of the universe.\"},\n",
